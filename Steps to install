PIP (Python Package Installer) is a tool used to install and manage Python packages.
It simplifies the process of downloading and installing libraries or modules required for Python projects. 
This guide explains how to install PIP on a Windows system and verify the installation.

How to Install PIP on Windows – Simplified Steps
Step 1: Check if PIP is Already Installed
Open the Command Prompt.
Type pip --version and press Enter.
If you see a version number, PIP is already installed.
If not, proceed to the next step.

Step 2: Download the PIP Installation Script
Open your web browser.
Go to the following link:
https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
Download the file and save it in a folder (e.g., Downloads).

Step 3: Install PIP Using the Script
Open the Command Prompt.
Navigate to the folder where the get-pip.py file is saved.
For example, if the file is in the Downloads folder:
Type cd Downloads and press Enter.
Run the script to install PIP by typing:
python get-pip.py and press Enter.

Step 4: Verify the Installation
After the installation completes, check if PIP is installed:
Open the Command Prompt (if not already open).
Type pip --version and press Enter.
If installed successfully, it will display the PIP version number.

Step 5: (Optional) Add PIP to PATH
If the system says "PIP is not recognized," you need to add PIP to the PATH environment variable:

Locate the Python installation folder (e.g., C:\Python312).
Inside it, find the Scripts folder (e.g., C:\Python312\Scripts).
Add this folder to your system PATH:
Go to Control Panel → System → Advanced system settings → Environment Variables.
Edit the Path variable and add the Scripts folder path.

Now PIP is ready to use! You can install Python packages like this:

Example: Install the numpy library → pip install numpy.
