PIP (Python Package Installer) is a tool used to install and manage Python packages.
It simplifies the process of downloading and installing libraries or modules required for Python projects. 
This guide explains how to install PIP on a Windows system and verify the installation.

How to Install PIP on Windows – Simple Steps
Step 1: Check if PIP is Already Installed
Open Command Prompt.
Type pip --version and press Enter.
If it shows a version number, PIP is already installed. If not, go to the next step.
Step 2: Download the PIP Installer
Open a web browser.
Go to https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py.
Download the file and save it (e.g., in your Downloads folder).
Step 3: Install PIP
Open Command Prompt.
Go to the folder where you saved the file.
For example, if it's in Downloads, type:
cd Downloads
Run the file by typing:
python get-pip.py
Step 4: Verify PIP Installation
Open Command Prompt.
Type pip --version and press Enter.
If you see a version number, PIP is installed successfully.


Now PIP is ready to use! You can install Python packages like this:
